This is code repo for our TALLIP paper, [Reinforced NMT for Sentiment and Content Preservation in Low-resource Scenario.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3450970#abstract), which implements the RL algorithms on top of a pre-trained MLE model to fine-tune generic purpose NMT model for translating affective text.
